# Katherine, the sexy framework
Katherine is a small (but perfectly formed!) 'square one' for web designers. It's aim is to be uncomplicated, lightweight, and easily 'hackable'. It's quick, easy, and a little bit sexy.

## Katherine features:
+ A highly edited/ruined version of the skeleton framework - using percentages rather than pixels
+ Sexyness

#### v1
+ The first upload! Exciting stuff! Much,. much more to come.

Katherine was originally built by Oliver Williams - who ripped off everyone else xoxo
