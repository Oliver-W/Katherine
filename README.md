# Katherine, the sexy framework
Katherine is a small (but perfectly formed!) 'square one' for web designers. It's aim is to be uncomplicated, lightweight, and easily 'hackable'. It's quick, easy, and a little bit sexy.

## Katherine features:
+ A highly edited/ruined version of the skeleton framework - using percentages rather than pixels
+ Massive amounts of raw sexyness

#### v1
+ The first upload! Exciting stuff! Much, much more to come, this is just to set it all up :)

Katherine was originally built by Oliver Williams - who ripped off everyone else in the process xoxo
